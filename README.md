# nanogenmo15
This repository is going to hold my [NaNoGenMo 2015](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015) entry (assuming I actually complete it). My issue on the main NaNoGenMo repoistory is [here](https://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo-2015/issues/43).

As of this writing (11/2/2015), I'm trying to build something having to do with the [GovTrack API](https://www.govtrack.us/developers/api).

## Building

Currently the only thing to do to build is cloning the repository, installing the dependencies, and then bootstrapping the Presidential speeches.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/amarriner/nanogenmo15.git
npm install
grunt bootstrap
```
